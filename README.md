# GovGPT
Here is the python stuff for GovGPT. It is a simple python script that allows users to fill out a study guide for AP Gov given by a certain teacher. May they know that we learn the material by choice, not by force.

## Reminder
After cloning the directory, make sure to chaneg your API key and other details in the final.py

## How to Install
For Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asost/GovGPT
cd GovGPT/
